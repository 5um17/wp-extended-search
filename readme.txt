Extend search functionality to search in selected post meta, taxonomies, post types, and all authors.

== Description ==
WP Extended Search is a lightweight and powerful search plugin.

With this plugin you can customize WordPress search to search in Post Meta, Author names, Categories, Tags, or Custom Taxonomies via admin settings. You can control the default behavior of WordPress to search in the post title, post content, and post excerpt.

Apart from customizing default search behavior, you can create multiple search settings, and then you can assign these settings to custom search forms.
For custom search forms, you have the option to choose from a widget, shortcode, PHP function, or HTML.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it compatible with WooCommerce? =

Yes, It is. When WooCommerce is active you will see a new checkbox in setting "Optimize for Products Search" select it and then the search results will use the default WooCommerce template or the template from your theme.

= How can I add a search form? =

You can use the Widget, Shortcode, and PHP function to display the search form. Also, you can add a hidden HTML field to your existing searchform.php template.

= Can I use my default search form widget? =

Yes, you can. You can modify the global setting to alter the results from the default search form. An extra search form is needed only when you would like to have more than one search criteria on the site.

= Can I use this plugin just to add a specific search form to my site and leave the WordPress default search as it is? =

Yes, you can. Go to the Search Settings and select Global in setting name, there you will see a button to disable the global search.
As global search is disabled now you can add a new search form with specific search criteria.

= How can I customize the search form? =

You can add custom CSS to the theme to style the search form. Or you can set CSS classes in the widget, shortcode, and PHP function.
Also, you can add a complete custom template for each search setting in the theme.
